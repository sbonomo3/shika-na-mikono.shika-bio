%\item[Subtopic:]{}
\item[Materials:]{Shovel/jembe, Banana peel, plastic bottle, rubber bands, paper}
%\item[Setup:]{}
\item[Procedure:]{Dig several small holes and place a different item in each, covering them with dirt. Check back on the items after several weeks, months, and after a year.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
\item[Observations:]{The banana peel shrivels and degrades after a couple weeks, while the other items remain for many months or even years.}
\item[Theory:]{Banana peels are an example of organic waste. They are \emph{biodegradable}}, meaning that it breaks down in the environment. \emph{Non-biodegradable} waste does not break down, it just piles up.
\item[Applications:]{Do not throw plastic bottles out of the window on buses!!}
