%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
\item[Observations:]{Students using spoons should be able to gather the most beans and rice.}
\item[Theory:]{There is always competition or struggle between organisms for limited resources such as food, space, etc. Only well adapted organisms survive while the less adapted are eliminated (survival of the fittest).}
