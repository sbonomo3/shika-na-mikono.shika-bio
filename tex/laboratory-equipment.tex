Procedure: Take an empty water bottle and remove the cap. Cut them in half. The upper part of the bottle can be used as a funnel.\\


\subsection*{Heat Source}


Use: Heating substances.\\
Materials: Candles, kerosene stoves, charcoal burners, metal can and moto poa.\\
Procedure for making a Moto Poa stove: Cut a metal can in half and add a little moto poa, then light for quick heat.\\


\subsection*{Petri Dishes}


Use: To grow cultures or display small specimens.\\
Materials: Water bottle and scissors.\\
Procedure: Take empty plastic bottles of different sizes. Cut about 1 inch up from the bottom of the bottle. Lids of different containers can also be used at petri dishes.\\


\subsection*{Scalpels}


Use: To dissect different organisms. \\
Materials: Knife, box cutter, or razor blades.\\


\subsection*{Spatula}


Use: To transfer small amounts of a solid substance.\\
Materials: Wooden, plastic, or metal spoon, a knife and plastic bottle.\\
Procedure: Cut a thin rectangle from plastic water bottle half way so that it resembles a spatula.\\


\subsection*{Stopper}


Use: To close a bottle or make an airtight seal.\\
Materials: Bottle caps, Sandals (ndala), and a knife.\\
Procedure: Cut a spherical piece of a sandal according to the size of the stopper you need.\\


\subsection*{Sweep Net}


Use: To catch insects.\\
Materials: Large stick, scissors, mosquito net, string.\\
Procedure: Get a mosquito net with a ring. Stitch the ring to the net to the net to make it firm. Cut out a rectangular notch from the center of the stick. Insert the ring together with the net into the notch in the stick, then secure them with a string. Tie a string around the bottom of the net and remove the excess net with scissors.\\

\subsection*{Test Tubes}


Use: To hold a small amount of liquid for examination or testing.\\
Materials: Syringe, candle or heat source, and a hard surface.\\
Procedure: Buy syringes of different volume from a pharmacy. Remove the plunger and the needle. Burn the bottom with a candle till the plastic begins to melt, then press the melted bottom against a hard surface to close.\\
Hazards: Remove the needle from the syringe. Never use syringes with the needles. Never provide needles to the students.\\


\subsection*{Test Tube Holders}


Use: To hold test tubes while heating.\\
Materials: A small piece of wood and a rubber band.\\
Procedure: Tie a rubber band to a piece of dry wood, then wrap the rubber band around the test tube. Fold a piece of paper in such a way that it can hold a test tube.\\

\subsection*{Watch Glass}


Use: To display small specimens.\\
Materials: Water bottles and scissors.\\
Procedure: Take empty plastic bottles of different sizes. Cut about 1 inch up from the bottom of the bottle. Lids of different containers can also be used as watch glasses.\\


\subsection*{Water Bath}


Use: To heat substances without using a direct flame.\\
Materials: Heat source, water, and a cooking pot.\\
Procedure: Bring water to a boil in a small aluminium pot, then place the test tubes in the water to heat the substance inside the test tube.\\


\subsection*{White Tile}


Use: To easily observe colour changes in leaves.\\
Materials: Glue or cellotape, wood block, white paper, and plastic sheeting\\
Procedure: Using cellotape or glue, cover a wood block with white paper. Then cover the white paper with a plastic sheet to prevent water from wetting the paper.


\subsection*{Water Drop Microscope}


Use: To magnify very small organisms so they are easier to observe.\\
Materials: Stiff sheet of plastic sheeting, clothes pins, block of wood, sheet of metallic gift paper, cardboard box, glue, and light source, blotting paper, hole punch, knife or razor blade, and water.\\
Procedure: 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Cut a rectangular piece of stiff plastic sheeting, about 3 cm x 7 cm.
\item Using a paper hole punch, make a round hole in the plastic rectangle. 
\item Glue the plastic rectangle to the end of a clothes pins so that the hole hangs over the end of the clothes pin.
\item Glue this clothes pin to the centre of a block of wood.
\item Take apart another clothes pin and use the two pieces to make the slide holder. Glue them to the board on either side of the first clothes pin such that a slide can rest on top of them just below the water drop hole.
\item Cut a small piece of gift paper/aluminium foil to act as a mirror.
\item Glue one edge of the foil into the cardboard box.
\item When the glue has dried, lift the other end so that the mirror is at an angle directing light towards the ``microscope".
\item Place a drop of water on the hole you punched in the plastic sheeting by using your finger.
\item \textit{Optional}: Take apart a clothes pin and use it as a wedge in the jaw of the first clothes pin. Slide it in to lower the drop of water towards the slide and pull it out to raise the drop. This acts as a course adjustment knob.
\item Another clear piece of stiff plastic can be used as the slide for holding a specimen.
