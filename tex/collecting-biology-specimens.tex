\chapter{Collecting Biology Specimens}

When teaching Classification, we will need a variety of organisms that may not always be available. Below is information about each Kingdom, Phylum, and Class on the O-level syllabus  and how to collect, preserve, kill, and dissect examples in each.

\section{Kingdom Fungi}
The following are features of Kingdom Fungi:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{They have no roots, stems, or leaves.}
\item{They lack chlorophyll, are non-photosynthetic and have to get their own food by feeding on dead plants or animals. (Notice the lack of green colour, because of lack of chlorophyll)}.
\item{Most fungi have cell walls made of chitin, which is a polysaccharide.}
\item{Their body is made of a network of small, tube-like filaments called hyphae.}
\item{Fungi store carbohydrates as glycogen.}
\item{Fungi reproduce asexually by small structures called spores.} 
\end{enumerate}

There are 3 major phyla in Kingdom Fungi. These are Phylum Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, and Ascomycota.
\subsection{Phlyum Basidiomycota}

\textbf{Mushrooms and Toadstools (Uyoga)}\\
Basidiomycota is the most common division of the Fungi Kingdom. Mushrooms and toadstools are in this division. The part of the mushroom that grows above the ground is the reproductive body and is divided into a stem, cap, and gills. Spores are released from the gills and are dispersed by wind.

\subsubsection{Collection}
Mushrooms should be collected during the rainy season. Mushrooms can be found on dead and decaying materials like logs in the forest. Mushrooms may also be purchased in supermarkets.

\subsubsection*{Preservation} 
Dry mushrooms in sunlight or preserve them in alcohol (a clear methylated spirit that is 70 \% alcohol and 30 \% water).

\subsubsection*{Dissection}
For the dissection of a mushroom, remove the cup of the mushroom and observe the gills. Cut the stem vertically with a razor blade and observe the inside.

\subsection{Phylum Zygomycota}

\textbf{Bread Mould and Mucor (Ukungu wa mkate, ukungu wa muhogo)}\\
Zygomycota grows on rotting material and looks like small white thread. An example of Zygomycota is bread mould or mucor.

\subsubsection{Collection}

Bread mould may be cultured by exposing some slices of bread to moisture. If you live in a dry area, add a few drops of water to the bread and close in a clear bag.
For mucor culture from fruits like tomatoes, keep in warm and moist conditions. In dry areas, enclose in clear bags. 

\subsection{Phylum Ascomycota}

\textbf{Yeast (Hamira)}\\
Ascomycota are single-celled organisms called yeast that grow on the surface of rotting fruit and reproduce by budding. Yeast is used to bake bread and create alcohol.

\subsubsection{Collection}
Yeast can be purchased at any shop.

\subsubsection*{Preservation} 
Keep yeast in an air-tight container.

\section{Kingdom Plantae}
Organisms in Kingdom Plantae are eukaryotic. Kingdom Plantae is very large and contains many plants.
Although organisms in this group look very different, they all get their nutrition from a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a way to manufacture food from simple materials with the help of the sun.
 The following are features of Kingdom Plantae:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{In all plants, the cell walls are made up of cellulose.}
\item{They demonstrate autotrophic nutrition -- they manufacture their own food through photosynthesis.}
\item{They have chlorophyll.}
\item{They are multicellular and the plant body is separated into tissues, organs, and systems.}
\end{enumerate}

There are 4 major divisions in Kingdom plantae. These are Division Bryophyta, Filiciniophyta, Coniferophyta, and Angiospermophyta.
\subsection{Division Bryophyta}
\textbf{Mosses and Liverworts}\\
Bryophyta are mosses and liverworts. They live on the land, but can only grow in wet places because they have no way to carry water. They also need water to reproduce.\\
These are the features of Division Bryophyta:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{They have no true roots, stems, or leaves.}
\item{They have no vascular tissue.}
\item{They reproduce by using spores.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Collection}
In dry places, moss should be collected during the rainy season. Moss and liverwort can be found on rocks or trees in moist climates or in rocky riverbanks. 

\subsubsection*{Preservation} 
Once moss or liverwort has been collected, it can be kept for several days on a rock placed in a container with water.

\subsection{Division Filicinophyta}
\textbf{Ferns}\\
Division Filicinophyta are ferns. Ferns grow in moist, shady environments like ground beds of forests. \\
The following are the features of Division Filicinophyta:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{They have true roots, stems, and leaves.}
\item{They have vascular tissue (xylem and phloem).}
\item{The leaves make sori which will later produce spores so the fern can reproduce.}
\item{The leaves are called fronds.}
\item{They grow in damp and shady places.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Collection}
Ferns can be found in shady and humid environments, usually in forests. 

\subsubsection*{Preservation} 
Ferns can be dried inside a book for future use. Place a fern between two pieces of paper and then place them into a book. Add more weight on top of the book and wait a few weeks. These specimens will be very delicate but will last a long time.

\subsection{Division Coniferophyta}
\textbf{Pine Trees (Mivinje)}\\
 Coniferophyta is a division of Kingdom Plantae. Coniferophyta are cone bearing plants with needle-shaped leaves. The male cones are smaller and produce a yellow powder called pollen. The female cones are larger and have small seed-like structures called ovules.\\
The following are the features of Division Coniferophyta:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{They are mostly shrubs and trees with needle shaped leaves.}
\item{Their reproductive structures are cones.}
\item{The ovule are not enclosed inside an ovary wall.}
\item{The majority are evergreens, which means they keep their leaves all year round.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Collection}
Coniferophyta can be found in cooler, higher climates like Mbeya, Iringa, and Lushoto. Choose a branch that includes both needle shaped leaves and a cone.

\subsubsection*{Preservation} 
Coniferophyta can be dried in the sun and stored in a dry place for future use.

\subsection{Division Angiospermophyta}
\textbf{Flowering Plants (mimea itoayo maua)}\\ 
Division Angiospermophyta consists of all flowering plants. \\
The following are the features of Division Angiospermophyta:
\begin{enumerate}

\item{Ovules are enclosed in an ovary and seeds are enclosed in a fruit.}
\end{enumerate}

Division Angiospermophyta can be divided into two classes; Monocotyledons and Diocotyledons.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Monocotyledons}}
Monocotyledon seeds have only one cotyledon. Monocots have a fibrous root system, leaves with parallel venation, three part floral systems, and vascular bundles which are scattered. Examples of monocotyledons are maize and grasses.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Dicotyledons}}
Dicotyledons seeds have two cotyledons. They also have a tap root system, leaves with net-like veins, floral parts in four or fives, and vascular bundles which form a ring in the stem. Examples of dicotyledons are mangoes, cashews, beans, and okra.

\subsubsection{Collection}
Angiosperms are easily found in your surrounding environment. Monocotyledons are organisms like maize plants and grasses. Dicotyledons are organisms like mango trees, cashew nut trees, and okra.

\subsubsection{Preservation} 
Flowers and leaves can be dried in a book. Place the flower or leaf between two sheets of paper and then press these in the centre of a book. Place the book in a safe place and add more books on top. Leave for a few weeks and then remove.

\subsubsection{Dissection}
Hibiscus flowers can be easily dissected using a razor blade to identify the reproductive parts.
